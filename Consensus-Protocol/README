*This folder will contain all documentation related to my semester 
project. 

*For my project I am learning how to make a formal specification of a 
system and how to verify a formal specification. I am using the TLA+ 
programming language to write a consensus protocol specification and 
verify the correctness of the specification with TLC Model Checker.

*I will concentrate mostly on safety properties over temporal properties. Leslie Lamport says that safety properties are where 90% of errors are found. The main goal of doing a formal specification is to find errors in the logic of a system.
