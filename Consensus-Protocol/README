*This folder will contain all documentation related to my semester 
project. 

*For my project I am learning how to make a formal specification of a 
system and how to verify a formal specification. I am using the TLA+ 
programming language to write a consensus protocol specification and 
verify the correctness of the specification with TLC Model Checker.

*I will concentrate mostly on safety properties over temporal properties. Leslie Lamport says that safety properties are where 90% of errors are found. The main goal of doing a formal specification is to find errors in the logic of a system.

*Primary Project Documents:
Channel.tla: comes from Lamport's Specifying Systems book. Comments are my explanations of the formulas.
Channel.ps: this is the Channel.tla file, as typeset using TLaTeX, with command "java tla2tex.TLA Channel.tla".
ConsensusStub.tla: this is the TLA+ module that I developed. It refers a lot to the Channel module above. 
ConsensusStub.ps: this is the ConsensusStub.tla file, as typeset by TLaTeX, with command "java tla2tex.TLA ConsensusStub.tla".

*Secondary Documents:
Other documents are files that I created in the course of learning and studying Lamport's Specifying Systems book.
These are mostly example exercises from the book, which I worked through.
They are of secondary importance.
