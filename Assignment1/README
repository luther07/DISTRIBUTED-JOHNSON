Started building some tests the week of 5/16/11.
Fixed blatant error in powers/2 function found during testing.

I. Process
	A. Starts by running the bash script, "RunHashSets.sh".
	B. The bash script compiles all of the necessary modules
	C. Then the bash script runs method "prep_file" in module "prep" and runs the "stop" method from the "init" module.
	D. The bash script prints "file is prepped".
	E. Then the file uses a loop to repeatedly run method "get_args" from module "mainprogram", passing parameters.
	F. Each execution of method "get_args" in module "mainprogram" will first get the arguments passed from the bash script.
	G. Then the method converts the strings arguments to integers.
	H. Then the method assigns the argument integers to variables N, D, and K.
	I. Finally the "get_args" method calls the method "program", using arguments N, D, and K.
