Started building some tests the week of 5/16/11.
Fixed blatant error in powers/2 function found during testing.

I. Process
	A. Bash script "RunHashSets.sh":
		1. Process starts when you execute the bash script, "RunHashSets.sh".
		2. The bash script compiles all of the necessary modules.
		3. Then the bash script executes the "prep" module's function "prep_file" followed by the "init" module's "stop" function.
		4. Then the bash script uses a loop to repeatedly run the "mainprogram" module's function "get_args", passing parameters N, D, and K.

	B. Each execution of the "mainprogram" module's function "get_args" does the following:
		1. Each execution will first get the arguments passed from the bash script.
		2. Then the function converts the string arguments to integers.
		3. Then the function assigns to variables N, D, and K the converted integer arguments.
		4. Finally the "get_args" function calls the "mainprogram" module's function "program", passing parameters N, D, and K.
	
	C. Execution of function "program" in "mainprogram" module:
		1. The function assigns to variable "TabId" a new ets (erlang term storage) table of type set.
		2. We assign the value of N*D/100 to the variable PercentNum.
		3. We measure the amount of time it takes to execute function "hashin" in module "hashmod", passing parameters TabId, N, and K, and assign this value to the variable "InputTime".
		4. We measure the amount of time it takes to execute function "hashout" in module "hashmod", passing parameters TabId, PercentNum, and K.
		5. We measure the amount of time it takes to execute function "rehash" in module "hashmod", passing parameters TabId, PercentNum, and K.
		6. We extract the time measured for executing "hashin" and append to file N, the time measure, and a comma.
		7. We extract the time measured for executing "hashout" and append to file the time measure, and a comma.
		8. We extract the time measured for executing "rehash" and append to file the time measure and a newline character.
		9. We execute the init module's stop function.		
		10.We go back to the start of the loop.
