% I had to create this functions because the BIF returns float and I need integer.
% This function has been tested and it works. (BIF means built in function.)
% 18 May 2011: Now this has really been tested and really works.

%This function has been presenting problems. Not sure what's wrong yet. I'll fix it in no time!
%After adding debugging outputs I find that this function is probably working correctly.
